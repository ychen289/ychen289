<h2>Hi there, I'm YiFan ChenðŸ‘‹ </h2>

---
I'm a software engineer that graduated from Fullstack Academy back in February of 2023, and I focus mainly on Fullstack development with a preference on backend. In mid 2020, I decided that Physical Therapy wasn't it for me, and I pivoted from pursuing a Doctorate in PT towards learning software. I was fascinated by the intricacies of Human Physiology (I still am!), but now I'm even more fascinated by the intracacies of code and the amazing products that derive from that!

- ðŸŒŽ I'm currently located in NYC but I'm open to relocationg anywhere!
- ðŸ“§ Feel free to contact me at <a target="_blank">yifanchen931@gmail.com</a>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on developing my Python and Java proficiency
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can pop my shoulder in and out effortlessly ðŸ’€

<h3>I enjoy working with these technologies</h3>
