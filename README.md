### Hi there, I'm YiFan ChenðŸ‘‹ 

---
I'm a software engineer that graduated from Fullstack Academy back in February of 2023, and I focus mainly on fullstack development with a preference on backend. In mid 2020, I decided that physical therapy wasn't it for me, and I pivoted from pursuing a Doctorate in PT towards learning software. I was fascinated by the intricacies of human physiology (I still am!), but now I'm even more fascinated by the intracacies of code and the amazing products that derive from that!
